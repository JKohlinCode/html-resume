<h1>Hobbies and interests</h1>
<p>Beyond my role as a system developer and GIS engineer, I find fulfillment in a range of interests that add depth to my professional profile. Programming and coding are not just career pursuits for me; they're hobbies that allow me to explore creative solutions and stay connected with evolving technologies.</p>
<p>In my downtime, I'm a gadget enthusiast, always eager to discover and appreciate the latest innovations. This interest not only keeps me informed but also sparks ideas for potential applications in my work.</p>
<p>Living in Västerås, Sweden, offers the added benefit of being surrounded by nature. I cherish the simple joy of spending time outdoors, often accompanied by my partner and our dog Nellie. Nature provides a much-needed balance, allowing me to recharge and approach my work with a clear perspective.</p>
<p>In summary, my hobbies serve as a harmonious counterpoint to my professional life, emphasizing a well-rounded approach to both personal and career development.</p>
